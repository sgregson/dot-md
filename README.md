# dotfiles-md

Maintain your system configuration as a collection of installable markdown blocks

## Usage
> _**Requires:** node.js_. See [contributing] for instructions on installing a local copy

Simply navigate to your folder of markdown and then run the interactive CLI:

```sh title="run the program" disabled=true
$ npx dotfiles-md
```

![running the demo](./docs/demo_screenshot.png)

Or if you have a dotfile ready-to-go, invoke it with:

```sh title="invoke a dotfile" disabled=true
$ npx dotfiles-md --auto DOTFILE.md
```

### CLI Commands

_run the `help` command to view help pages_

```sh disabled=true
$ npx dotfiles-md --help
```

## Writing your Dotfiles in markdown

**Code block metadata**

Each codeblock is created with three backticks (`) or tildes (~) and assigned a **space-delimited** collection of metadata:

    ```<lang> [filePath] [...options]
    ```

This should generally be compatible with other documentation systems.

The **`<lang>` directive** is the usual markdown code block langauge format. It is used to specify the syntax highlighting of the code snippet but may in the future be used to direct the `action=run` directive.

A **`[filePath]` option** may be provided in order to direct the output of the code block. It **must not** contain an equals sign `=`.

The **`[...options]` array** is a space-delimited list of `key=value` directives defining how the CLI should act on this code block. Values must be quoted if they contain spaces as in, `key="Some Value"`.

**Codeblock Options and Actions**

- `action` defines what to do with the content:
  - `=build`: build the file to `[filePath]`, replacing content as appropriate
  - `=run`: run this code block according to the file syntax (js: node, sh, bash, zsh)
  - `=symlink`: find-replace patterns (`%...`) in the codeblock and symlink the result (from `/build`) to `[filePath]`
  - `=section`: use the contents of the code block as a section divider in the CLI
- `title=<string>` a title for the code block to appear in the CLI. `<string>` must be quoted if it contains spaces.
- `when` defines the availability of this codeblock
  - `=os.darwin`, `=os.win32`: platform-specific dotfiles
- `disabled=<string>`: prevent a block code block from being runnable. The `<string>` is displayed in the UI.

### Install or Run Locally

```sh action=run title="install and run dotfiles-md" disable=true
# Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:sgregson/dotfiles-md.git
# Go to the project directory
cd dotfiles-md
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Run the interactive CLI
npx dotfiles-md --help
```

## Roadmap

- [x] implement `when=<conditions>` (v0.3.0)
- [x] implement `action=run` (v0.4.6) for imperative settings (see [demo/README.md](demo/README.md))
- [ ] implement find-replace from `.env` files
  - idea: command to find all replacement keys in dotfiles (create a `.env.schema` from MD contents) for use with `dotenv-extended`
- (idea) Title codeblocks from nearest heading (To support spaces and use as fallback for missing `title=`)
- (idea) Update & Improve Interface UI: 2-panel layout for navigation and show a codeblock
- (idea) Generate diff when file a exists instead of the current overwrite/backup flow

## FAQ

#### Why markdown files?

Specifically, **literate markdown**. IMHO dotfiles (or configuration in general) should be organized in a way that makes sense to you for fast recall and organization. From there you can choose whether to manipulate your `$PATH` or direct them to known defaults (like `~/.gitconfig` vs `!/.config/git/config`).

I also really liked the topic-centric approach of other dotfiles managers (like [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)) but found I need to give myself WAY more context on the operations than code comments since I update them so infrequently.

#### Why an interactive CLI?

All my old dotfiles systems relied on either a "bag of scripts" folder or someone else's CLI. I loved using [kody](https://github.com/jh3y/kody) for a long time, but updating the dotfiles became difficult as my config grew stale.

#### Why the repo structure?

- `demo/`: A functional demo folder of dotfiles. see demo/README.md
- `dotfiles/`: My actual, personal, dotfiles. Use for inspiration or whatever
- `src/`: the CLI script codebase
